- Simple, professional icons for navigation and key sections, complementing the overall minimalist design. Icons should be easily understandable and visually consistent.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as a smooth scroll or a fade-in effect when loading new content. Avoid excessive animations that distract from the content.
